# Reload Failure
Reload Failure is an open source HTML5 game written in TypeScript. The graphics and gameplay are inspired by game Teleglitch.

## Features
- Pseudo 3D, implemented in pure 2D canvas
- War fog
- Hardcoded textures
- Entire combat system is not finished :P

## Disclaimer
This is the final project of my APCSP project. Since it is already graded, I cannot see any reason not releasing the source code. As a result, I decided to upload it to GitHub. At the same time, I do hope anyone who is interested will find this project helpful and educational.

Furthermore... CollegeBoard don't disqualify me pls <33333.
